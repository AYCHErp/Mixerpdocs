# Inventory Management System

An inventory management system enables you to record and keep track of goods, properties, services, components, and raw materials that are in stock. It enables you to physically verify and manage items that come in and go out during your day-to-day business operations.

The inventory management system also helps manage lead times, cost of inventory, and quality of the products. It helps you keep the costs at minimum by identifying issues and planning in such a way that items are available when they are needed.
