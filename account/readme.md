MixERP saves a plethora of data about your organization. And, not everyone should be entitled to access this information. Hence, MixERP's Account Management app enables you to filter user groups and provide access based on hierarchy level. Our advanced system helps you to divide your users into different groups, while serving specific information to only authorized groups.
