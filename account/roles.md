# Roles

User roles help you define authorization and access policies. With this application, you can entitle unique roles to users and create custom user groups. Depending on the role, you can set access rules and specify the resources that each group is allowed to access.

For instance, you want to display a set of information only to your management team. You have to go to the authorization page and make few administration changes, and the selected information will be displayed only to your management team.

Role management is still essential if your application has limited users. It offers flexibility and allows you to add or remove users without revamping the entire system. As you implement more rules for your application, Role management can be a crucial tool to apply changes for different set of users.
